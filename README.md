Very sorry . I had seen the email now because I was out looking for a programming job, and now I have seen the email today, Sunday, 04/21/2024. 12:00 pm.
Well, I'll leave you what I was able to do today. In 0.50 minutes, I found the error that wouldn't stop running the game.

1)- I made a forward declaration of the Player class inside the Player namespace
2)- The second error I found was the conversion from   float to integer type, which I solved with an implicit conversion with Static Cast<>



Part-4  What I wanted to boast about is that each enemy for a certain time sends a power-up that, once caught, two more ships appear next to it and can shoot equally.
